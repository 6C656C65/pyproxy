## üì¶ **Installation**

### Install from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/6C656C65/pyproxy.git
cd pyproxy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install with Docker
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/6c656c65/pyproxy:latest
docker run -d ghcr.io/6c656c65/pyproxy:latest
```
You can use slim images by adding `-slim` to the end of the tags

## üöÄ **Usage**

### Generate CA
If we want to generate a self-signed certificate authority, you can use the following OpenSSL command:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/ca/key.pem -out certs/ca/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```
Otherwise, upload your CA certificate `./certs/ca/cert.pem` and associated key `./certs/ca/key.pem`.

### Start the proxy
```bash
python3 pyproxy.py
```
The proxy will be available at: `0.0.0.0:8080`.
The access log will be available at `./logs/access.log`.

### Debug Mode
To run the proxy in debug mode, use the `--debug` option:
```bash
python3 pyproxy.py --debug
```

## üìö **Documentation**
If you encounter any problems, or if you want to use the program in a particular way, I advise you to read the [documentation](https://github.com/6C656C65/pyproxy/wiki).

## üîß **To do**

- Support content analysis
- Caching of latest and most searched pages
- Adding ACL
- Proxy authentication

## üèéÔ∏è **Benchmark**

If you're interested in benchmarking the performance of the proxy or comparing request times with and without a proxy, please refer to the [Benchmark README](benchmark/README.md) for detailed instructions on how to run the benchmarking tests and generate reports.
